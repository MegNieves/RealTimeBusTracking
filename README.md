### This repository was crafted for the Real Time Bus Tracking Solution for week 9. This webpage can be viewed via https://megnieves.github.io/RealTimeBusTracking/ As of now I would enjoy maniupulating map tracking further. As an avid Hiker I would like to set a distance between Mountain Ranges, estimate the time to Hike the trail depending on entry point. 
#### Within this repository are files necessary to manipulate maps on Web Pages and how to Render a Map on a web page.
